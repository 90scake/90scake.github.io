here i want to display cake picture and description and price of the cake. the price could be multiple for a cake, like for same cake there could be vanilla flavor and chocolate flavor. 1 pound vanilla flavor price could be 800bdt and for chocolate 900 BDT, for two pound the price could be more different. so there price will be array show the first of the array on card and if users hovers on the price the display othres on tooltip.
the picture could be multiple for a cake. if user click on a card then there will be a modal to to display the details of it and here display the pictures in sliding window and show other details bellow it, details like ingredient, notes, flavors, price list and so on. from the details view user can place order by selecting the flavor and pound . based on that show total price in the the modal (can use sliding page inside the modal.). after confirming the order send a Whatsapp message with all the detail he selected and pictures of page with product id in a WhatsApp number.
